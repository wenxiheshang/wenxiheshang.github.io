## 计算机工作模型

今天遇到一本书：*The pattern on the stone*.

这本书梳理了计算机得以工作起来的「层级结构」。

> 重要的不是细节，而是整体上记住并领悟这个让计算机疯狂运转起来的层级结构。
> 不多也不少，不要过于简单，也不要过于复杂。
> 抓住最重要的核心「概念」。

摘抄这么一段话：

> The work performed by the computer is specified by a program, which is written in a programming language. This language is converted to sequences of machine-language instructions by interpreters or compilers, via a predefined set of subroutines called the operating system. The instructions, which are stored in the memory of the computer, define the operations to be performed on data, which are also stored in the computer’s memory. A finite-state machine fetches and executes these instructions. The instructions as well as the data are represented by patterns of bits. Both the finite-state machine and the memory are built of storage registers and Boolean logic blocks, and the latter are based on simple logical functions, such as And, Or, and Invert. These logical functions are implemented by switches, which are set up either in series or in parallel, and these switches control a physical substance, such as water or electricity, which is used to send one of two possible signals from one switch to another: 1 or 0. This is the hierarchy of abstraction that makes computers work.

以上这段话，须反复品味，以此为「索引」，可以上下求索于计算机的汪洋世界。

编程语言分语义部分和语法部分，最为关键的其实是「语义」。要知道，语义本身就包含了完成一切事情所需的抽象化了的功能接口。

在掌握了编程语言后，最关键的是更快更好地表达出自己想要完成的任务。

如果无法表达想要完成的任务，那就去搜寻表达任务所需的「概念」和「词汇」，理解并掌握它们，然后就是运用它们，这是一个需要不断扩展的边界。

想要掌握编程，理解、领悟计算机的工作「层级结构」是基础，有了编程语言的实践心得，下一步要做的是理解、掌握那些在编程语言基础之上建构起来的更宏大的「层级结构」。
